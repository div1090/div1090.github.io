This is an android app that can use an inbuilt camera/video stream via Wifi/Wifi-Direct to recognize people from a pre-enrolled list of persons using Face Recognition. The goal is to be able to run the algorithms locally on the device without accessing API/servers running on the cloud & utilize only a single photo per enrollment.

For face recognition on the devices, the following libraries have been used/integrated:

 * [OpenCV FaceRecognition](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html#face-recognition-with-opencv)
 * [Facenet on Tensorflow](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)
