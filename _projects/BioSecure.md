A simple android app that was built to demonstrate continuous authentication as a viable authentication mechanism for mobile devices as part of GovernmentWare (GovWare) at [Singapore International Cyber Security Week 2017](https://www.sicw.sg/)

The app uses [Google's Mobile Vision API](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/vision/face/package-summary) for Face Detection & a pre-trained [VGGFace](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/) model built with caffe for Face Recognition served over REST API in the backend.
