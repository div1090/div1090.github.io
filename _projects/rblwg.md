This was part of a volunteering effort by [Data Kind Singapore Chapter](http://www.datakind.org/) to help [Wildlife Reserves Singapore Group](https://www.wrs.com.sg/en/conservation/our-work/conservation-of-singapores-own-raffles-bonded-langur.html) in the conservation of Raffles Banded Langurs in Singapore and Malaysia by providing a tool to help count the population of langurs from images taken by other volunteers over the year using data-analytics.

I was part of the team that helped create a website to collect training data. Check it out from the link above (it's a bit like tinder for langurs :P ).

Although I cannot provide the link to the actual source code, here's a link to the [boiler-plate](https://github.com/cloudhary/rblwgc) we started out with. Read more about the overall effort [here](http://www.datakind.org/blog/protecting-singapores-endangered-banded-leaf-monkey).
