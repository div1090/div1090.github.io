title: About Divya
---

				<p> Hello there!<br /><br />
					I am Divya and this is my personal digital cucoon. This is where I bring together my interests, ideas, and work!<br /><br />

					I work at Conex Systems as a Data Scientist. By day, I build systems to improve healthcare using Computer Vision and Data Science.
					By night, if I'm not out interacting with fellow human beings or reading, you'd fine me learning about something or the other that managed to keep my attention that day.<br /><br />

					I love to read & teach (the old fashioned way, with a board and everything.. no one has endured more than my younger brother who had to sit through many evenings where I desperately try to explain ideas that I had just come across and were obviously way beyond his years)
