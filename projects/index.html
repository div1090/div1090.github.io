<h5><a href = "http://rbl-classify.herokuapp.com/login">Raffles Banded Langur Conservation Project</a></h5>

<p>
This was part of a volunteering effort by <a href= "http://www.datakind.org/">Data Kind Singapore Chapter</a> to help <a href = "https://www.wrs.com.sg/en/conservation/our-work/conservation-of-singapores-own-raffles-bonded-langur.html">Wildlife Reserves Singapore Group</a> in the conservation of Raffles Banded Langurs in Singapore and Malaysia by providing a tool to help count the population of langurs from images taken by other volunteers over the year using data-analytics.

<p>
I was part of the 4 member team that helped create the website to collect training data. Check it out from the link above (it's a bit like tinder for langurs :P )
